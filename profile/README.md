# Well, hello there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to our little corner of GitHub! We are the Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration, "Arbeids- og velferdsforvaltningen", commonly known as [NAV](https://www.nav.no/hva-er-nav/en).

We build our software in the open. It is funded by the taxpayers, so it should be freely available. We also strongly believe that open source is a great vehicle for collaboration and that it enhances the quality of our products.

The things we build are mostly for internal use. Even if you are able to reuse our code you cannot expect any support to be provided. Feel free to raise issues in the repositories, our developers may answer at their own discretion.
